# TODO

* ~~Look into adding periodic rumble updates when data does not change~~
* ~~Look into newer version of HidGuardian~~
* ~~Look into distributing profile properties around various objects
rather than using a lot of getters to obtain properties each poll.
It will complicate the architecture a little bit but hopefully
any speed difference will make up for it.~~
* Remove old welcome dialog and make new driver installer executable.
Use newer standards (WPF) and bundle app with DS4Windows
